This directory contains the Ixsi v5 XSD files and an XJB file which controls the Java conversion process.
The Ixsi schema files are copied verbatim from the official Ixsi repositories.
They are copied here so that no hard dependency on the Ixsi distribution is created.
If there are changes to the Ixsi schema, the schema-describing files have to be copied over the currently stored versions.

The schema files are evaluated by the mkixsiv5stubs.sh script.
